# Approach Taken

* What is the game minimal requirements:
* Player suppose to be able to type a word in a given time limit
* Word suppose to be randomize
* For every correct word spell a score added to that player score
* I studied and practice time interval's
* I studied and practice more object oriented Javascript

* Container: 
    * width: 500px;
    * position: relative;
    * text-align: center;
    * width: 500px;
    * padding: 20px;
    * border-radius: 4px;

#### User stories
* A user must be able to select different game modes
* A user must be able to select different difficulties
* A user must be able to keep typing until the time is up
* 

## Development Plan
* I started working with HTML, contructing a game container. The container included a grid(divs). Using h1 and p tags to store the game score and word along with an input box to assign to later in Javascipt.

* Css portion next to display a box container using flexbox.
* I practice flexbox in codepen first. I spent several days getting the outline perfect.

* For Javascript section i broke it down into four potion. First part is puesdo coding the game logic and learning how time work's. Spent a couple days on that
* Second part declaring my global variables and connecting my HTML elements to the DOM. Started to implement the simple functionality of what i want the game to look like.
* Third part spent learning bootstrapping and how it works with the DOM. Adding more layers to my game 
* Fourth part is for adding more layers to the game. Adding objects and classes to DRY my code
 

#### Mvp

* Create a fun speed typing game for Kids
* Create Different game modes
* Create penalties, errors and a type off(can be chosen)


#### Stretch goals
* Create a extra window and create a chase the rabbit game



# Challenges: 
* Understanding time - there is a lot of different methods to using time interval. 
* Css and its uses with the DOM
* Learning the different String methods
